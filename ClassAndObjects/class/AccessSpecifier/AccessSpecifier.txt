There are 3 Types of Access Specifier

public      -> we can Access any where throughout the program

protected   ->we can Access throughout the class(within the class)
	    ->throughout the package (within the package)

	    ->We can also access in another package but we need to inherit the class which contains the protected method

	    ->which means we can also access the protected method in a child class even though the method is in another package

		->before inheriting we need to import the package			


		Commands to tun the protected file
		
		->make sure you are in protected directory
		
		javac PackageA\Student.java	->Compiles the class in the PackageA folder

		javac -cp . PackageB\Main.java	->Compiles a class that depends on another package

		java -cp . PackageB.Main	->Runs the Main class from its fully qualified name

		
		->Note: Run the same commands for Default too
			Make sure you are in default directory
		
private     -> we can Access only with in the class , 
                Outside of a class we can't Access a private Method



If you are not declared the method with any of the 3 Access Specifiers 
it will be Automatically declared with default Access Specifier


Default     ->we can Access throughout the class(within the class)
	    ->throughout the package (within the package)
	    ->we can't Access the method out side the package with default Access Specifier
