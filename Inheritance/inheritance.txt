Inheritance:
    Access the properties of one class into another class

Terminology:
super class - sub class
parent class - child class
base class - derived class

Term	        Description
superclass  -	The class whose properties are inherited
subclass    -   The class that inherits from the superclass
extends	    -   Keyword used for inherit the properties

Access the properties of one class into another class we need to use extends keyword

Note:
while using inheritance we need to generate object only for child class

Single Inheritance
    ->single parent for a single child
Multiple Inheritance
    ->multiple parents for a single child
    ->we can't extend both the parent classes at a time 
    ->so that we are using interfaces to implement multiple inheritance
    ->we can implement more then one interface classes at a time 
Multilevel Inheritance
    ->here one parent will have one child and that child contains of another sub-child
    ->looks in the form of genertions ->Here it is level by level access
Hierarichal Inheritance
    ->one parent class will have multiple child classes
    ->each child class can access the parent class
Hybrid Inheritance
    ->Hybrid inheritance is a Combination of both Multilevel and Hierarichal inheritance
