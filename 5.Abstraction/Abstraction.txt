Abstraction:

generally Abstraction is used to say hiding of unwanted data.

but practically abstract is a class which is used to hide the data.

we need to use a keyword called abstract to declare an abstract class

Syntax:

abstract class classname{
    //we can declare the variables
    //we can create abstract methods and non-abstract methods in abstract class
    //we can just declare abstract method , but we can't define the method
}


//when ever we created an abstract class 
// we need to generate the object to the child class of our abstract class 


Note:

we can create non abstract methods inside the abstract class

->since it is not 100% abstraction implementation

we can't create object to an abstract class

To overcome this there is a concept called interfaces


Interfaces:

To overcome the dis-advantage of abstraction , we use interfaces.

->interface class will have 100% abstraction,
	which means we can't Create non-abstract methods inside the interface class

->To create an interface, we need to use interface keyword ,
	we need to use implements keyword to inherit it to the child class

->when defining the abstract method in child class
	we must have to specify it with public access

->we can also implement multiple inheritance through interfaces by implementing morethen one interface at a time.
